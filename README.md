# URL Shortener and Management Platform

This project is a URL shortening and management platform that allows users to shorten URLs, track clicks, manage their account, and more.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have **Node.js** installed on your system before setting up the project.

## Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend will now be running locally.

## Frontend Setup

## Running Frontend with Local Backend

To connect the frontend to your local backend:

1. Go to the `/src/api/hooks.js` file in the frontend project.
2. Comment out the deployment URL and uncomment the local URL to ensure the frontend connects to your local backend server.

## Features Implemented

The platform includes the following features:

### 1. **URL Shortening**
   - Users can shorten long URLs into unique, shortened versions.
   - Shortened URLs are generated using a hash or random string (e.g., `https://<hostname>/<6-8 digit alphanumeric>`).
   - Expiration dates can be set for links, and they will automatically expire once the set date is reached.

### 2. **User Management**
   - User registration and login using email and password.
   - Passwords are securely hashed before being stored.
   - Users can update their profile information (name and email). If the email is updated, the user will be logged out.
   - Users can delete their account and all associated links and data.

### 3. **Dashboard**
   - Users can view a list of their shortened URLs, including:
     - Original URL.
     - Shortened URL.
     - Click analytics data.
   - Users can edit or delete their shortened URLs.

### 4. **Click Tracking**
   - Clicks on shortened URLs are tracked with metadata such as:
     - Timestamp.
     - IP address.
     - User agent (browser and OS details).
   - The collected click data is displayed on the user's dashboard.

### 5. **Link Management**
   - Users can manage their shortened links by:
     - Editing the original URL or its alias.
     - Deleting individual links.

### 6. **Analytics**
   - Detailed analytics are provided for each shortened link:
     - Device type (mobile, desktop, tablet).
     - Browser details.

### 7. **Responsive Design**
   - The platform is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 8. **Pagination**
   - Pagination is implemented in both the Links and Analytics sections for easier navigation through multiple records.
